# Domain Discovery Tool

## üìå Overview
**AsyuLynx Domain Discovery** is a Python-based asset exposure analysis tool designed to help security engineers, red teamers, and IT admins identify domain/IP risks.  

It aligns with **ISO/NIST best practices** for asset discovery and provides:
- DNS resolution (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME)
- WHOIS registrar lookup
- IP/ISP/Organization lookup
- HTTP(S) status classification (Internet / Intranet / Misconfig / Closed)
- Critical or Full port scanning
- Risk level assessment
- Export results to Excel with color-coded risk levels

---

## üöÄ Features
- Single or bulk mode (scan one or many targets)  
- DNS & WHOIS integration  
- IP/ISP lookup via ip-api.com  
- Critical vs Full port scan options  
- Risk classification (Low / Medium / High)  
- Excel export with risk heatmap coloring
